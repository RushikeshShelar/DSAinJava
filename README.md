# Data Structure and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to DSAinJava! This repository is dedicated to tracking my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey using the Java programming language. Here, I store my progress and solutions to DSA questions as I work towards mastering this fundamental skill set.


## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- Algorithms: Implementation of various algorithms in Java.
- Data Structures: Java implementations of fundamental data structures.
- Problem-Solving: Solved DSA questions categorized by topics.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning. 
## Usage
